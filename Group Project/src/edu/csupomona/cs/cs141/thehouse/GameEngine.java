 *	GameEngine is where almost everything from the other classes contribute to the game.
 *	The GameEngine takes user commands from {@link UserInterface}, checks with {@link Player},
 * 	and then performs the tasks. It is also where the {@link Enemy} class performs the actions 
 * 	it decides. GameEngine updates the {@link Grid} and retrieves positions from it. GameEngine
 * 	also checks to see if the {@link Player} has picked up any {@link PowerUp}s or if they have 
 * 	ammo left.
