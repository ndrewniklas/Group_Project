Background
The Galactic Empire has spread its forces too thin in its war against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In the wake of the ongoing battles, pirates make easy targets out of innocent freighters, stealing wares and selling them on the black market. Making supply runs is now so risky a business that only the toughest are willing to make the trips.
You are one of these so-called smugglers; however, nothing could prepare you for the brilliant ambush by Pirate Captain Rodriguez. They cut power to your ship, massacred your crew, stole your supplies, and planted a bomb in one of the ship’s many reactor cores. You find yourself with only one bullet against a ship full of pirates and a limited amount of time before the bomb goes off.
Forget honor, bravery, or ferocity – you just want to disarm the bomb so you can get off of the ship alive! In the words of Rodriguez, “Why are you waiting around? Get to it already! Now!”
